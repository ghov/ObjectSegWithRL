Already Done:
1. Extract images based on bbox and store them into their own directory.
2. Make a json of the polygon sizes called vertex_count_segmentation_ids:
    a. The key is the size of the polygon(number of vertices) and the value is the segmentation id. All of these
     segmentation ids only have one polygon representing their segmentation.


Finished on 07/08/2018
1.  Get the size of every cropped image (height and width) and store them in some json.
    a. The json key will be the tuple of (height, width) and the value will be a list of segmentation ids
    b. Since json doesn't allow tuple as a key, I had to convert each tuple to a string. So str(100,112) for example
    c. Saved to data/bbox_crop_shape.json
2. Use the above mentioned json to filter out images that are bad. The best way to do this currently is to consider the
    size of the image.
    a. The filter used was (height * width >=10,000) and the json was saved to data/bbox_crop_shape_gte10k.json


Need to do:

1. Need to have a way to cross-compare the vertex_count_segmentation_ids file with the bbox_crop_shape_ file
    a. i.e. Need to get rid of some file that are not meeting a requirement, such as size.
    b. Tried to do this, but it appears I fucked up. It looks like the bbox_crop_shape_gte10k file has 280669, while the
    vertex_count_segmentation_ids_gte10k has 468207. Not sure what happened here, but need to revisit it.

1. Resize the polygons for each segmentation with respect to the crop.
    a. Need to make sure no vertices are out of bounds.
    b. The y variable should all be <= the height and the x variables should be <= the width

2. Look through vertex_count_segmentation_ids and find a key with a large number of segmentation ids.
    a. Consider every segmentation id that has not been filtered out previously.
    b. Resize these images to (224, 224) move them to a new folder.
    c. Also resize the polygon for each image and store it in a json. The key will be the segmentation value and the
    value will be the polygon as a list of values. Need to make sure that no vertex is out of bounds of the image.

3. Probably should filter out images that are too thin or too wide. This is quite hard to get a good balance for though.
    Could also filter out images that don't have enough pixels in either height or width, but again this is hard to
    balance properly.

5. Need a way to put a segmentation mask on an image, just as in the coco functions.

6. Need to have more images with the same number of vertices. x3 = (x1 + x2)/2 and y3 = (y1 + y2)/2. Might want to
    consider points that are further away, though it may not matter.

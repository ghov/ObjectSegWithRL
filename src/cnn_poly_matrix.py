# This is an alternative to the polygon generation.
# Here, we will have a final vector that represents a polygon of size n.
# We will also have a ground truth polygon of the same size from MSCOCO. We can then set los=MSE(my_poly - ground_truth)
# Need to find ground truth polygons of the same size to do this.
